macro:->The
AFTE
range
of
conclusions
also
permits
the
examiner
to
decide
that
the
evidence
is
\emph
{unsuitable}
for
examination,
which
can
occur
if
evidence
quality
is
poor;
for
example,
a
fragment

a
cartridge
case
is
recovered
rather
than
a
full
cartridge
case.

macro:->This
assumption
of
equally-sized,
square
matrices
is
easily
enforced
by
padding
the
matrices
with
additional
missing
values.
Due
to
the
presence
of
(structurally)
missing
values
around
the
breech
face
impression
region,
additional
padding
does
not
interfere
with
the
structure
of
the
scan.

macro:->In
reality,
the
true
aligning
registrations
in
the
two
comparison
directions
are
opposites
of
each
other.
However,
because
we
compare
discretely-indexed
arrays
using
a
nearest-neighbor
interpolation
scheme,
the
estimated
registrations
may
differ
slightly.

macro:->If
more
than
one
cluster
is
identified,
we
binarize
the
points
based
on
whether
they
were
assigned
to
any
cluster
or
if
they
are
a
noise
point
and
proceed
as
if
there
is
only
one
cluster.
We
assume
that
two
or
more
clusters
form
only
because
of
the
course
rotation
grid
considered.
Were
a
finer
grid
used,
the
points
would
coalesce
into
a
single
cluster
around
the
true
translation
value.
This
assumption
has
empirical
support
through
our
experimentation.
